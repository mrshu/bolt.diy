# Bolt.new: AI-Powered Full-Stack Web Development in the Browser

Welcome to **Bolt.new**, where **AI meets instant web development environments**. Bolt.new is an AI-powered web development agent that allows you to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browser—no local setup required.

## What Makes Bolt.new Different

While tools like Claude and Vercel’s V0 offer AI-powered coding assistance, they fall short when it comes to providing **full control over the development environment**. That’s where Bolt.new stands out:

- **Full-Stack in the Browser**: Bolt.new integrates cutting-edge AI models with an instant development environment powered by **StackBlitz’s WebContainer**. This allows you to:
  - Install and run any npm tools and libraries (like Vite, Next.js, and more)
  - Run Node.js servers and backend processes
  - Debug and deploy code instantly
  - Share your work via a URL—all without leaving the browser

- **AI with Environment Control**: Unlike limited environments where the AI can only assist in code generation, Bolt.new gives AI models **complete control** over the development environment, from the terminal to the browser console. This empowers AI agents to handle the entire app lifecycle—from creation to deployment.

- **Zero Setup**: Start coding instantly. There’s no need for software installations or environment configuration. Just open the browser, and you’re ready to build.

Whether you’re an experienced developer or a quasi-technical PM or designer, Bolt.new helps you build production-grade full-stack applications with ease.

For developers interested in building their own AI-powered development tools, check out the [README](./subfolder/README.md) in the open-source code subfolder.

## Tips and Tricks

Here are some tips to get the most out of Bolt.new:

- **Be specific with your technologies**: If you're using specific frameworks or libraries (like Astro, Tailwind, ShadCN), mention them in your initial prompt to ensure Bolt sets up the environment accordingly.
  
- **Use the "Enhance" prompt button**: After getting results, click the "Enhance" button to refine them. You can also edit the results before submitting them for further AI processing.

- **Scaffold first, then build**: Make sure the basic structure of your application is in place before diving into more advanced functionality. This helps Bolt understand the foundation of your project.

- **Batch your instructions**: Save time by combining simple instructions into one message. For example, you can ask Bolt to change the color scheme, add mobile responsiveness, and safely restart the dev server—all in one go.
